(** * Weak-head call-by-value evaluation strategy.

  The [wcbveval] inductive relation specifies weak cbv evaluation.  It
  is shown to be a subrelation of the 1-step reduction relation from
  which conversion is defined. Hence two terms that reduce to the same
  wcbv head normal form are convertible.

  This reduction strategy is supposed to mimick at the Coq level the
  reduction strategy of ML programming languages. It is used to state
  the extraction conjecture that can be applied to Coq terms to produce
  (untyped) terms where all proofs are erased to a dummy value. *)
